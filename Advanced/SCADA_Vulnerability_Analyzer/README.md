# **README: SCADA Vulnerability Analyzer**

## **Overview**

The **SCADA Vulnerability Analyzer** is a Zsh-based script designed to scan Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for common vulnerabilities. It provides tools to identify open ports, weak credentials, and insecure configurations in SCADA systems, enabling researchers, system administrators, and students to understand potential risks and improve system security.

---

## **Features**

1. **Port Scanning**:
   - Scans a SCADA system for open ports within a specified range.
   - Identifies potential entry points for attackers.

2. **Default Credential Check**:
   - Tests for common default usernames and passwords on the SCADA systemâ€™s admin interface.
   - Helps identify weak authentication configurations.

3. **System Configuration Analysis**:
   - Checks connectivity and tests for outdated or weak encryption protocols like TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0.
   - Ensures the system is using secure protocols.

4. **Logging**:
   - Records all findings in a log file (`scada_vulnerability_report.log`) for further analysis.

## **Educational Objectives**

1. **Understand SCADA Vulnerabilities**:
   - Learn about the most common weaknesses in SCADA systems and why they matter.
   - Explore how attackers can exploit open ports, weak credentials, and insecure protocols.

2. **Develop Security Awareness**:
   - Understand the importance of regular security audits and vulnerability assessments for critical infrastructure.

3. **Hands-On Experience**:
   - Gain practical experience with port scanning, credential testing, and system analysis using tools integrated into the script.

## **How to Use**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- A Linux system with Zsh installed.
- Root or admin privileges to execute certain commands.
- SCADA system or simulation to test (only use on authorized systems).

### **2. Save the Script**
- Save the script as `scada_vulnerability_analyzer.zsh`.

### **3. Make It Executable**
```bash
chmod +x scada_vulnerability_analyzer.zsh
```

### **4. Run the Script**
```bash
sudo ./scada_vulnerability_analyzer.zsh
```

### **5. Follow the Menu Options**
- **Option 1**: Scan for open ports.
- **Option 2**: Check for default credentials.
- **Option 3**: Analyze system configuration.
- **Option 4**: Exit the script.

## **Sample Outputs**

### **Port Scanning**:
```
Scanning open ports on 192.168.1.10 in the range 1-100...
Port 22 is OPEN
Port 80 is OPEN
Port 443 is OPEN
Port 23 is CLOSED
```

### **Default Credential Check**:
```
Checking for default credentials on 192.168.1.10:8080...
Default credentials found: admin:admin
```

### **System Configuration Analysis**:
```
Analyzing system configuration on 192.168.1.10...
Ping to 192.168.1.10 successful: System is reachable.
Checking for weak encryption protocols...
Weak protocol detected: TLSv1.0
Protocol SSLv3 not detected.
```

## **Log File**

The script logs all outputs to `scada_vulnerability_report.log` for review and reporting. Example log entries:
```
2024-01-01 10:00:00 Port 22 is OPEN
2024-01-01 10:05:00 Default credentials found: admin:admin
2024-01-01 10:10:00 Weak protocol detected: TLSv1.0
```

## **Real-Life Use Cases**

1. **SCADA Security Audits**:
   - Test SCADA systems in industries like energy, water, and manufacturing for vulnerabilities.
2. **Training and Education**:
   - Teach cybersecurity professionals and students about SCADA security risks.
3. **Research**:
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of SCADA security measures and configurations.

## **Legal and Ethical Use**

- **Authorized Testing Only**:
  - This script must only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
- **Critical Infrastructure**:
  - SCADA systems often control essential infrastructure. Unauthorized testing can lead to severe consequences, including service disruptions or legal penalties.

---

## **Potential Enhancements**

1. **SCADA Protocol Analysis**:
   - Add support for SCADA-specific protocols like Modbus or DNP3.
2. **Detailed Credential Database**:
   - Expand the default credential list for comprehensive testing.
3. **Report Generation**:
   - Generate detailed reports summarizing all findings and recommendations.
4. **Multi-Threaded Scanning**:
   - Improve efficiency by enabling concurrent scans.

## **Conclusion**

The **SCADA Vulnerability Analyzer** is a powerful tool for identifying and understanding vulnerabilities in SCADA systems. It provides a hands-on approach to security assessment and highlights the importance of securing critical infrastructure. Use this tool responsibly to learn, test, and improve SCADA system security!

# **README: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication Exploiter**

## **Overview**

The **Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Exploiter** script is an educational tool designed to simulate and understand potential vulnerabilities in V2V communication systems. It provides hands-on experience with sniffing, spoofing, and simulating denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in a controlled and authorized environment. This script uses the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol as the foundation, which is commonly used for inter-vehicle communication.

**Important Note**: This script is for **educational purposes only** and must not be used on real-world systems or vehicles without explicit authorization.

## **Features**

1. **Sniff V2V Communications**:
   - Uses `cansniffer` to monitor live CAN messages on the network.
   - Provides insights into how vehicles communicate in real time.

2. **Spoof V2V Messages**:
   - Sends fake CAN messages using `cansend` to test how systems react to unexpected or malicious data.

3. **Simulate Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks**:
   - Floods the CAN bus with repetitive messages to demonstrate the impact of a DoS attack.

4. **Educational Focus**:
   - Helps users understand the potential vulnerabilities in V2V communication and the importance of implementing robust defenses.

## **How It Works**

1. **Sniffing Communication**:
   - Uses `cansniffer` to capture and display messages being exchanged on the CAN bus.
   - Example: Monitoring vehicle speed, location data, or other telemetry.

2. **Message Spoofing**:
   - Simulates an attacker sending a forged message (e.g., fake speed data) to disrupt or manipulate the system.
   - Example: Sending a false proximity alert to trigger unnecessary braking.

3. **Denial-of-Service Attack**:
   - Simulates flooding the CAN bus with a high volume of messages to overwhelm legitimate communication.
   - Example: Blocking critical safety messages like collision warnings.

## **Setup and Requirements**

### **Dependencies**

1. **Required Tools**:
   - `can-utils`: A suite of tools for working with CAN bus.
     ```bash
     sudo apt install can-utils
     ```

2. **Hardware**:
   - A CAN-enabled interface, such as a USB-to-CAN adapter (e.g., CANtact).
   - Alternatively, set up a virtual CAN interface for testing:
     ```bash
     sudo modprobe vcan
     sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
     sudo ip link set up vcan0
     ```

3. **Permissions**:
   - Root privileges (`sudo`) are required to interact with the CAN interface.

## **How to Use**

1. **Save and Set Up the Script**
   - Save the script as `v2v_exploiter.zsh`.
   - Make it executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x v2v_exploiter.zsh
     ```

2. **Run the Script**
   ```bash
   sudo ./v2v_exploiter.zsh
   ```

3. **Follow the Menu Options**:
   - **Option 1**: Sniff live V2V communications on the specified CAN interface.
   - **Option 2**: Spoof messages by sending custom CAN messages to the network.
   - **Option 3**: Simulate a denial-of-service attack by flooding the CAN bus.
   - **Option 4**: Exit the script.

## **Sample Outputs**

### **1. Sniffing Communications**
```
Starting V2V communication sniffing on interface can0...
ID: 0x123 Data: 02 03 04 05
ID: 0x124 Data: FF 00 01 10
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

### **2. Spoofing Messages**
```
Enter the CAN interface (e.g., can0): can0
Enter the message ID to spoof (e.g., 0x123): 0x123
Enter the data payload to send (e.g., 01 02 03 04): 01 02 03 04
Spoofing V2V message on interface can0...
Message spoofed: ID=0x123, Data=01 02 03 04
```

### **3. Simulating DoS Attack**
```
Enter the CAN interface (e.g., can0): can0
Enter the target message ID to flood (e.g., 0x123): 0x123
Simulating DoS attack by flooding message ID 0x123 on interface can0...
(Continuous flooding starts. Press Ctrl+C to stop.)
```

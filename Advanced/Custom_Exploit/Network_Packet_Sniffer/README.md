# **README: Network Packet Sniffer**

## **Overview**

The **Network Packet Sniffer** is a Zsh-based script that uses `tcpdump` to monitor network activity, capture packets, and analyze them for insights. This tool provides a hands-on introduction to network traffic analysis, enabling users to explore how data flows through networks, identify suspicious patterns, and troubleshoot issues.

This project is intended for **educational purposes only**, offering a safe environment to learn about network monitoring and security.

## **Features**

1. **List Available Network Interfaces**:
   - Displays all network interfaces available on the system (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).

2. **Packet Capture**:
   - Captures network packets on a selected interface and saves them to a file for analysis.

3. **Packet Analysis**:
   - Reads and analyzes captured packets to understand network activity and potential issues.

4. **Packet Logging**:
   - Saves captured packets in `.pcap` format, which can be analyzed with tools like Wireshark.

## **Educational Objectives**

### **1. Learn Packet Sniffing Basics**
- Understand how `tcpdump` captures network traffic and what data is contained in packets.
- Gain insights into protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and ICMP.

### **2. Explore Traffic Patterns**
- Observe normal and suspicious network behavior by analyzing captured packets.

### **3. Build Practical Networking Skills**
- Learn to use command-line tools for network monitoring and troubleshooting.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Dependencies**
The script relies on `tcpdump` for packet capture. It checks for the tool during runtime and exits if not installed.

### **2. Features and Usage**
- **List Interfaces**:
  - Displays available network interfaces, excluding loopback (`lo`) and virtual interfaces (e.g., Docker).
  - Example output:
    ```
    Available Network Interfaces:
    eth0
    wlan0
    ```

- **Start Packet Sniffing**:
  - Captures all traffic on the selected network interface and saves it to a `.pcap` file.
  - Example output:
    ```
    Starting packet capture on interface eth0...
    Packets will be saved to packet_sniffer_capture.pcap. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
    ```

- **Analyze Captured Packets**:
  - Reads the `.pcap` file and displays packet details in a human-readable format.
  - Example output:
    ```
    10:00:01.123456 IP 192.168.1.100.5000 > 192.168.1.1.80: Flags [S], seq 0, win 65535, options [mss 1460], length 0
    ```

## **How to Use**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- A Linux system with `tcpdump` installed.
- Root or admin privileges (required to monitor network interfaces).

### **2. Save and Set Up the Script**
1. Save the script as `network_packet_sniffer.zsh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x network_packet_sniffer.zsh
   ```

### **3. Run the Script**
```bash
sudo ./network_packet_sniffer.zsh
```

### **4. Follow the Menu Options**
- **Option 1**: List available network interfaces.
- **Option 2**: Start capturing packets on a selected interface.
- **Option 3**: Analyze packets captured in the `.pcap` file.
- **Option 4**: Exit the script.

## **Sample Workflow**

### **Step 1: List Interfaces**
Run the script and choose `Option 1` to see available interfaces:
```
Available Network Interfaces:
eth0
wlan0
```

### **Step 2: Capture Packets**
Select `Option 2`, specify the interface (e.g., `eth0`), and capture packets:
```
Starting packet capture on interface eth0...
Packets will be saved to packet_sniffer_capture.pcap. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

### **Step 3: Analyze Packets**
Choose `Option 3` to analyze the captured packets:
```
Reading captured packets from packet_sniffer_capture.pcap...
10:00:01.123456 IP 192.168.1.100.5000 > 192.168.1.1.80: Flags [S], seq 0, win 65535, options [mss 1460], length 0
```

## **Real-World Applications**

1. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Diagnose slow network connections or dropped packets.
   - Identify traffic bottlenecks.

2. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Detect unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
   - Identify unexpected data flows or malicious packets.

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Capture and analyze packets after a security breach to understand attacker behavior.

---

## **Potential Enhancements**

1. **Add Protocol Filters**:
   - Allow filtering by protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP) for focused packet captures.

2. **Real-Time Analysis**:
   - Display captured packets in real-time instead of saving to a file.

3. **Geolocation Data**:
   - Integrate IP geolocation tools to identify packet sources.

4. **Alerting System**:
   - Trigger alerts for suspicious traffic patterns, such as port scans or repeated failed connections.

## **Legal and Ethical Considerations**

1. **Authorized Use Only**:
   - Use this script only on networks you own or have explicit permission to monitor.
   - Unauthorized network monitoring is illegal and unethical.

2. **Privacy and Compliance**:
   - Respect user privacy and comply with all relevant laws and regulations.

## **Conclusion**

The **Network Packet Sniffer** script is a powerful educational tool for exploring network traffic and understanding the fundamentals of packet analysis. It introduces essential skills for network troubleshooting, security monitoring, and incident response. Use this script responsibly to enhance your knowledge of networking and cybersecurity!

# **README: ADS-B Fuzzer Script**

## **Overview**

The **ADS-B Fuzzer Script** is a Zsh-based tool designed to generate and send synthetic ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) messages. ADS-B is a protocol used by aircraft to broadcast real-time information such as location, altitude, and speed. This script is intended for educational purposes, testing, and research in secure and authorized environments.

## **Features**

1. **Randomized ADS-B Message Generation**:
   - Generates synthetic ADS-B messages with randomized parameters such as:
     - **ICAO Address**: Unique identifier for the aircraft.
     - **Altitude**: Ranges from 0 to 40,000 feet.
     - **Latitude and Longitude**: Random geographic coordinates.
     - **Speed**: Ranges from 0 to 600 knots.
     - **Heading**: Random direction (0 to 360 degrees).

2. **Message Logging**:
   - Logs all generated messages with timestamps to a file (`adsb_fuzzer.log`) for analysis.

3. **Simulated Transmission**:
   - Outputs generated messages for testing purposes. Replace `rtl_adsb` with a real transmission tool for hardware-based testing.

4. **Interactive Menu**:
   - Simple menu-driven interface to generate messages or exit the script.

## **Prerequisites**

### **1. Required Tools**
- **rtl_sdr**:
  - Used for interacting with SDR devices and generating ADS-B signals.
  - Install with:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install rtl-sdr
    ```
- **rtl_adsb**:
  - A tool from the rtl-sdr suite for handling ADS-B messages.

### **2. Permissions**
- Root privileges may be required to access SDR hardware or perform certain operations. Run the script with `sudo`.

---

## **How to Use**

### **1. Save the Script**
- Save the script as `adsb_fuzzer.zsh`.

### **2. Make the Script Executable**
```bash
chmod +x adsb_fuzzer.zsh
```

### **3. Run the Script**
```bash
sudo ./adsb_fuzzer.zsh
```

### **4. Follow the Menu Options**
- **Option 1**: Start generating and sending synthetic ADS-B messages.
- **Option 2**: Exit the script.

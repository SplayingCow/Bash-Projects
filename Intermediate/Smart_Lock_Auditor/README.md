# **README: Smart Lock Authentication Auditor**

## **Overview**
The **Smart Lock Authentication Auditor** is a Zsh-based script designed to monitor and analyze Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication between a smart lock and its paired device (e.g., smartphone or key fob). This script uses tools from the BlueZ suite (`hcitool` and `hcidump`) to scan for nearby BLE devices and log communication events for auditing purposes.

---

## **Features**

1. **Scan for BLE Devices**:
   - Identifies all nearby BLE devices and logs their MAC addresses.
2. **Monitor Smart Lock Communication**:
   - Captures and logs BLE communication packets between the smart lock and paired devices.
3. **Detailed Logs**:
   - Records communication events with timestamps, MAC addresses, and packet data for analysis.

---

## **Prerequisites**

### **1. Required Tools**
- **BlueZ**:
  - Includes `hcitool` and `hcidump` for BLE scanning and packet capturing.
  - Install on Debian-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install bluez
    ```

### **2. Permissions**
- Root privileges are required to access BLE hardware and capture packets.
- Run the script with `sudo`.

---

## **How to Use**

### **1. Save the Script**
- Save the script as `smart_lock_auditor.zsh`.

### **2. Make It Executable**
```bash
chmod +x smart_lock_auditor.zsh
```

### **3. Run the Script**
```bash
sudo ./smart_lock_auditor.zsh
```

### **4. Follow the Menu Options**
- **Option 1**: Scan for BLE devices.
  - Displays all nearby BLE devices and their MAC addresses.
- **Option 2**: Monitor a specific smart lock.
  - Enter the MAC address of the smart lock to start monitoring communication.
- **Option 3**: Exit the script.

### **5. Stop Monitoring**
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop monitoring BLE communication.

## **Sample Outputs**

### **Console Output (Scanning BLE Devices)**:
```
Scanning for nearby BLE devices...
Scan complete. Devices found:
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF (Smart Lock)
11:22:33:44:55:66 (Phone)
```

### **Console Output (Monitoring Communication)**:
```
Monitoring BLE communication with AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF... Press Ctrl+C to stop.
Logged: 2024-01-01 12:34:56, AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF, HCI Event Packet Data
```

### **Log File (`smart_lock_audit_log.txt`)**:
```
Timestamp, MAC Address, Data
2024-01-01 12:34:56, AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF, HCI Event Packet Data
2024-01-01 12:34:57, AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF, HCI Event Packet Data
```

## **Key Use Cases**

1. **Authentication Monitoring**:
   - Audit communication events to ensure the smart lock is only interacting with authorized devices.

2. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Identify connectivity issues between the smart lock and paired devices.

3. **Security Auditing**:
   - Detect suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or replay attacks.

4. **Learning and Research**:
   - Explore BLE communication protocols and understand how smart locks authenticate devices.

---

## **Educational Value**

1. **Understanding BLE Communication**:
   - Learn how devices like smart locks use BLE for authentication and data exchange.

2. **Hands-On Scripting**:
   - Gain experience with Zsh scripting and tools like `hcitool` and `hcidump`.

3. **Cybersecurity Insights**:
   - Discover potential vulnerabilities in BLE-based smart locks and how to monitor for threats.

---

## **Potential Enhancements**

1. **Packet Decoding**:
   - Add functionality to parse BLE packets and extract authentication details.

2. **Filtering**:
   - Filter out irrelevant devices during scanning to focus only on smart locks.

3. **Real-Time Alerts**:
   - Notify the user of suspicious or unauthorized activity on the BLE network.

4. **Logging to a Database**:
   - Save logs to a database for advanced analysis and long-term storage.

5. **Integration with Visualization Tools**:
   - Display BLE communication patterns in a graphical format for better understanding.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **Tools Not Found**:
   - Ensure BlueZ is installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install bluez
     ```

2. **No Devices Detected**:
   - Verify that the Bluetooth adapter is active:
     ```bash
     hciconfig
     ```
   - Enable the adapter if necessary:
     ```bash
     sudo hciconfig hci0 up
     ```

3. **Permission Denied**:
   - Run the script with `sudo`.

4. **Incomplete Logs**:
   - Ensure the Bluetooth adapter is close enough to the smart lock to capture all communication.

# **README: Kernel-Simulated Security Monitoring Script**

## **Overview**

The **Kernel-Simulated Security Monitoring Script** is a Zsh-based tool designed to simulate kernel-level monitoring using Linux’s user-space auditing tools. By leveraging tools like `auditd` and `auditctl`, this script provides a hands-on educational platform to understand system call tracking, file access monitoring, and log analysis.

This script mimics kernel-space functionality, providing insights into how operating systems monitor and log events to enhance security. It is ideal for learning, testing, and improving system security in a controlled environment.

## **Educational Objectives**

1. **Understand Kernel-Level Monitoring**:
   - Learn how system calls and file access events are tracked in Linux.
   - Explore the importance of monitoring for detecting suspicious activity.

2. **Practical Security Monitoring**:
   - Use Linux auditing tools to simulate kernel-level logging and monitoring.

3. **Log Analysis Skills**:
   - Gain experience filtering and analyzing logs to detect unauthorized access or other security events.

4. **Learn Core Security Concepts**:
   - Understand how event monitoring can prevent and mitigate cyber threats.

---

## **Features**

1. **Initialize Monitoring**:
   - Sets up the auditing framework and prepares the environment for logging system events.

2. **Monitor System Calls**:
   - Tracks system call events, such as file opens, writes, or program executions, in near real-time.

3. **Monitor File Access**:
   - Tracks read, write, execute, or attribute changes for specific files or directories.

4. **Log Analysis**:
   - Analyzes logs to identify patterns of suspicious activity, such as brute-force login attempts or unauthorized file modifications.

---

## **How It Works**

### **1. Initialization**
- Starts the `auditd` service and prepares the system for event monitoring.
- Clears any existing audit rules to avoid conflicts.

### **2. Monitoring System Calls**
- Uses `ausearch` to track system call events as they occur.
- Mimics kernel-level syscall logging by recording events such as file accesses or program executions.

### **3. File Access Monitoring**
- Uses `auditctl` to monitor specific files or directories.
- Captures details of file access events, such as which user accessed a file and what action was performed (read/write/execute).

### **4. Log Analysis**
- Filters the log file for events of interest, such as unauthorized access attempts or execution of suspicious commands.
- Saves the analysis results to a file for further review.

---

## **Setup and Requirements**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **Tools**:
  - `auditd`: The Linux auditing framework.
  - Install with:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install auditd audispd-plugins
    ```
- **Permissions**:
  - Requires `sudo` privileges to configure audit rules and monitor system events.

---

### **Installation**
1. Save the script as `kernel_simulation.zsh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x kernel_simulation.zsh
   ```

### **Running the Script**
Run the script with:
```bash
sudo ./kernel_simulation.zsh
```

---

## **Menu Options**

1. **Initialize Monitoring**:
   - Prepares the system for monitoring and clears existing audit rules.

2. **Monitor System Calls**:
   - Tracks and logs system call events in near real-time.

3. **Monitor File Access**:
   - Monitors specific files or directories for access attempts or changes.

4. **Analyze Logs**:
   - Filters logs for suspicious patterns and saves the analysis to a file.

5. **Exit**:
   - Exits the script.

## **Examples**

### **1. Initialize Monitoring**
```bash
Initializing Kernel-Simulated Security Monitoring...
Log file: kernel_simulation.log
Simulated Kernel Space Security Log
Enabling audit framework...
Audit framework initialized.
```

### **2. Monitor System Calls**
```bash
Monitoring system calls for suspicious activity...
2024-01-01 12:00:00 type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1643452800.123): arch=c000003e syscall=2 success=yes
```

### **3. Monitor File Access**
```bash
Enter directory or file to monitor (e.g., /etc/passwd): /etc/passwd
Monitoring file access for /etc/passwd...
2024-01-01 12:00:01 type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1643452801.123): arch=c000003e syscall=2 filename="/etc/passwd"
```

### **4. Analyze Logs**
```bash
Analyzing log file for suspicious activity...
2024-01-01 12:00:00 type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1643452800.123): arch=c000003e syscall=2 filename="/etc/passwd"
2024-01-01 12:00:10 type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1643452810.123): arch=c000003e syscall=59 a0=0x1 a1=0x2
Analysis complete. Results saved to suspicious_activity.log.
```

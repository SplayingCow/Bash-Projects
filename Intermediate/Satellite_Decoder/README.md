# README: Satellite Signal Decoder Script

## **Overview**
The **Satellite Signal Decoder Script** is a Zsh-based tool designed to capture and decode satellite signals using an SDR (Software Defined Radio) device. It uses `rtl_fm` to receive raw signals and `gr-satellites` to decode them. This script can be used to analyze satellite communications for educational purposes, signal analysis, and cybersecurity monitoring.

---

## **What This Script Does**

1. **Captures Satellite Signals**:
   - Uses `rtl_fm` to tune into specific frequencies and save raw signal data.
2. **Decodes Satellite Signals**:
   - Processes raw signals with `gr-satellites` to extract meaningful information.
3. **Interactive Menu**:
   - Provides options to capture signals, decode previously captured data, or exit.

## **Prerequisites**

### **1. Required Hardware**
- **RTL-SDR Dongle**:
  - An inexpensive USB device that acts as a software-defined radio receiver.
  - Example: RTL2832U chipset-based devices.

### **2. Required Software**
- **rtl-sdr**:
  - For capturing signals from the SDR dongle.
  - Install it with:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install rtl-sdr
    ```
- **gr-satellites**:
  - A GNU Radio-based decoder for satellite signals.
  - Install it with:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install gr-satellites
    ```

### **3. Permissions**
- Root privileges may be required to access the SDR hardware and run the script.

## **How to Use**

1. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the script as `satellite_signal_decoder.zsh`.

2. **Make It Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x satellite_signal_decoder.zsh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./satellite_signal_decoder.zsh
   ```

4. **Follow the Menu**:
   - **Option 1**: Capture satellite signals and save the raw data to a file.
   - **Option 2**: Decode a previously captured signal.
   - **Option 3**: Exit the script.

5. **Stop the Signal Capture**:
   - Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the signal capture.

## **Key Features**

1. **Customizable Frequency and Sampling Rate**:
   - Easily modify `CENTER_FREQ` and `SAMPLE_RATE` in the script to target specific satellites.
2. **File-Based Workflow**:
   - Saves captured signals to a file for later analysis, allowing flexibility in processing.
3. **Interactive User Interface**:
   - Intuitive menu-driven approach for ease of use.

## **Use Cases**

1. **Educational Applications**:
   - Learn about satellite communication and signal processing.
2. **Signal Monitoring**:
   - Capture and analyze satellite transmissions for insights into signal behavior.
3. **Cybersecurity Research**:
   - Understand potential vulnerabilities in satellite communications and test security measures.
4. **Weather Data Analysis**:
   - Decode signals from NOAA weather satellites to extract weather imagery.

## **Potential Enhancements**

1. **Real-Time Decoding**:
   - Stream the signal directly to `gr-satellites` without saving to a file.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add robust error messages for hardware or software issues.
3. **Satellite Tracking**:
   - Integrate with tools like `GPredict` to automate tuning based on satellite position.
4. **Signal Visualization**:
   - Include graphical tools to visualize the spectrum or decoded data.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **No Signal Captured**:
   - Ensure the SDR dongle is properly connected and the antenna is positioned for optimal reception.
   - Verify the satellite is in range (use tracking tools like `GPredict`).
2. **Missing Tools**:
   - Reinstall missing dependencies:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install rtl-sdr gr-satellites
     ```
3. **Permission Issues**:
   - Run the script with elevated privileges:
     ```bash
     sudo ./satellite_signal_decoder.zsh
     ```

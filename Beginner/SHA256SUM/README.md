# File Integrity Checker Script

## Overview

The **File Integrity Checker Script** is a Bash-based tool that automates file integrity verification using `sha256sum`. It helps ensure that files have not been tampered with or corrupted by comparing their current checksums against previously generated reference checksums.

## What Was Learned

### **1. Importance of File Integrity**

- **Concept**: File integrity means ensuring that a file remains unchanged from its original state.
  - **Why it matters**: File corruption, malicious modifications, or unauthorized changes can compromise system security, software reliability, or sensitive data.
  - **Example**: Verifying that a downloaded software package matches its official checksum ensures it hasn’t been tampered with by attackers.

### **2. Using ****`sha256sum`**** for Checksum Generation**

- **Command**: `sha256sum` generates a unique hash (checksum) for a file based on its content.
  - **Why it’s important**: A checksum acts like a fingerprint for the file; any change in the file will result in a completely different checksum.
  - **Example**: Imagine photocopying a unique barcode for a package. If the barcode changes, you know the package was opened or replaced.

### **3. Automating Checksum Verification**

- **Process**: Automating checksum generation and verification reduces manual errors and speeds up the process for multiple files.
  - **Why it’s important**: Automation ensures consistency and minimizes oversight, especially in environments with many files.
  - **Example**: Think of automating package inspections with a barcode scanner instead of manually comparing barcodes one by one.

### **4. Practical Bash Scripting Skills**

- **Functions**: Modular functions (`generate_checksums` and `verify_checksums`) simplify code maintenance and readability.

  - **Why it’s important**: Functions allow reuse and make scripts easier to debug and extend.
  - **Example**: Like splitting a recipe into individual steps (e.g., mixing, baking), making the process manageable and repeatable.

- **User Interaction**: Using `read` and menu-based input makes the script interactive and user-friendly.

  - **Why it’s important**: Interactive scripts adapt to user needs, improving accessibility for non-technical users.
  - **Example**: Think of a touchscreen ATM guiding you through each step versus requiring a manual on how to operate it.

### **5. Ensuring Security Through Verification**

- **File Verification**: Using `sha256sum -c` compares current file states against the saved checksums.
  - **Why it’s important**: Detects unauthorized changes to critical files, acting as an early warning for potential breaches.
  - **Example**: Like checking a sealed envelope for tampering before opening it.

## Why This Script Is Important

### **1. Enhanced Security**

- Protects against **tampering**: Detects unauthorized modifications to critical system files or sensitive documents.
- Verifies **downloaded files**: Ensures software packages or updates are authentic and untampered.
  - **Example**: Verifying a downloaded ISO file before installation to ensure it hasn’t been corrupted or altered.

### **2. Practical Automation**

- Simplifies integrity checks for large datasets or directories.
  - **Example**: Regularly verifying backups to ensure they remain uncorrupted over time.

### **3. Reliable Error Detection**

- Quickly identifies mismatches and alerts the user.
  - **Example**: Discovering a corrupt configuration file before deploying it in a production environment.

### **4. Educational Value**

- Reinforces foundational skills in Bash scripting and command-line utilities.
- Demonstrates real-world applications of hashing and checksum verification.
  - **Example**: Learning these skills can apply to more advanced tasks like managing digital signatures or securing APIs.

## Examples and Comparisons

### Example 1: Software Download Verification

**Scenario**: A user downloads a Linux ISO file and wants to verify its authenticity.

- **Without script**: Manually run `sha256sum <file>` and compare the output to the official checksum, risking errors.
- **With script**: The user generates checksums for all files in the directory and verifies them automatically, saving time and reducing mistakes.

### Example 2: Backup File Validation

**Scenario**: A team maintains regular backups of sensitive data and needs to ensure they remain unchanged.

- **Without script**: Open each backup file and manually inspect it, which is impractical for large datasets.
- **With script**: Automate the process with scheduled checksum verification, ensuring backups are intact without manual effort.

### Comparison: Manual vs. Scripted Verification

| Task                | Manual Approach                    | Scripted Approach                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Efficiency**      | Slow and prone to human error      | Fast and reliable                 |
| **Scalability**     | Not feasible for large directories | Handles large directories easily  |
| **User Experience** | Requires technical expertise       | User-friendly with guided prompts |

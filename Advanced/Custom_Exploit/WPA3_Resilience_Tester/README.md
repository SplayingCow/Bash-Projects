# **README: Wi-Fi WPA3 Resilience Tester**

## **Overview**

The **Wi-Fi WPA3 Resilience Tester** is a Zsh-based script designed to test the security of WPA3-protected wireless networks. It allows users to:
1. Scan for available Wi-Fi networks.
2. Capture WPA3 handshake packets for analysis.
3. Perform a dictionary attack to assess the network’s resilience against common password-guessing techniques.

This tool is intended for **educational and authorized use only**, providing insights into WPA3 security mechanisms and helping users strengthen their networks.

## **Features**

1. **List Available Networks**:
   - Scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and highlights those using WPA3 encryption.

2. **Capture WPA3 Handshake**:
   - Captures the handshake packets exchanged during a client-to-access-point connection.

3. **Test Dictionary Attack**:
   - Uses a provided wordlist to simulate a brute-force attack and assess network resilience.

4. **Educational Insight**:
   - Learn about WPA3’s **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)** handshake and its resistance to offline attacks.

## **How It Works**

1. **Scanning Networks**:
   - Uses `iw` to scan for available Wi-Fi networks and filters for WPA3-enabled networks based on RSN (Robust Security Network) data.

2. **Capturing Handshake**:
   - Uses `airodump-ng` to capture the handshake between a client and the WPA3-enabled router.

3. **Dictionary Testing**:
   - Simulates a brute-force attack using `aircrack-ng` with a provided wordlist to test password strength.

---

## **Setup and Requirements**

### **Dependencies**
1. **Required Tools**:
   - `iw`: For scanning Wi-Fi networks.
   - `aircrack-ng`: For handshake capture and dictionary attack testing.
2. **Network Adapter**:
   - A Wi-Fi adapter that supports **monitor mode** is necessary.
3. **Root Privileges**:
   - The script requires `sudo` for certain operations like packet capture.

### **Installation**
- Ensure dependencies are installed:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install iw aircrack-ng
  ```
- Save the script as `wpa3_resilience_tester.zsh`.
- Make it executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x wpa3_resilience_tester.zsh
  ```

## **How to Use**

1. **Run the Script**
   ```bash
   sudo ./wpa3_resilience_tester.zsh
   ```

2. **Follow the Menu Options**:
   - **Option 1**: List all available networks and identify WPA3-secured networks.
   - **Option 2**: Capture a WPA3 handshake for a specified network.
   - **Option 3**: Test a handshake file against a wordlist to simulate a dictionary attack.
   - **Option 4**: Exit the script.

## **Sample Outputs**

### **Listing Networks**
```bash
Scanning for available Wi-Fi networks...
SSID: MyHomeNetwork
  (Secure Network)
SSID: GuestNetwork
```

### **Capturing Handshake**
```bash
Enter the Wi-Fi network SSID: MyHomeNetwork
Enter the capture file name (e.g., handshake.pcap): myhome_handshake.pcap
Starting handshake capture for network MyHomeNetwork...
Handshake capture completed. File saved as myhome_handshake.pcap.
```

### **Testing Dictionary Attack**
```bash
Enter the handshake capture file: myhome_handshake.pcap
Enter the wordlist file: common_passwords.txt
Testing WPA3 resilience with dictionary attack...
Reading packets from myhome_handshake.pcap
Passphrase not in dictionary.
Dictionary attack test completed.
```

## **Educational Objectives**

1. **Understand WPA3 Handshake Mechanisms**:
   - Learn how WPA3 uses the **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)** handshake to secure connections.
   - Explore the improved resistance to offline attacks compared to WPA2.

2. **Assess Password Strength**:
   - Use the dictionary attack feature to evaluate the strength of your Wi-Fi password against common attacks.

3. **Practice Ethical Hacking**:
   - Gain hands-on experience in network security and learn how to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

---

## **Legal and Ethical Considerations**

### **Authorized Use Only**
- Use this tool **only** on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.
- Unauthorized network testing is illegal and unethical.

### **Privacy and Compliance**
- Do not use the tool to intercept or analyze traffic from devices not under your control.

---

## **Potential Enhancements**

1. **Advanced Filtering**:
   - Add options to filter networks by signal strength, channel, or encryption type.
2. **Automated Reporting**:
   - Generate a report summarizing handshake captures and dictionary attack results.
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Display live network activity during handshake capture.
4. **Support for Other Protocols**:
   - Extend functionality to analyze WPA2 networks for backward compatibility testing.

## **Conclusion**

The **Wi-Fi WPA3 Resilience Tester** is a powerful educational tool for understanding and evaluating the security of WPA3 networks. It provides hands-on experience with key tools and concepts in wireless security, helping users to identify vulnerabilities and reinforce their network defenses. Always use this script responsibly and legally to protect networks from unauthorized access.

# **README: Satellite Command Emulator**

## **Overview**

The **Satellite Command Emulator** is a Zsh-based script that simulates the process of sending, receiving, and interpreting satellite commands. It provides an educational platform for understanding satellite communication protocols, potential vulnerabilities, and the importance of secure command channels. This emulator highlights risks like spoofed commands and demonstrates how secure practices can mitigate these threats.

This tool is intended for **educational purposes only** and must be used in controlled, authorized environments.

## **Features**

1. **Initialize Emulator**:
   - Sets up the emulator, creating a log file for recording commands and responses.

2. **Send Commands**:
   - Simulates sending predefined satellite commands such as:
     - **POWER_ON**: Powers on the satellite.
     - **DEPLOY_PANEL**: Deploys solar panels.
     - **RESET**: Resets the satellite systems.
   - Logs commands and their simulated responses.

3. **View Command Log**:
   - Displays a history of all sent commands and their outcomes for review and analysis.

4. **Simulate Spoofed Command Attack**:
   - Demonstrates how a malicious command (e.g., **SHUTDOWN**) could be injected and the potential consequences.

## **Setup and Requirements**

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Operating System**:
   - Compatible with Linux systems running Zsh.

2. **No External Dependencies**:
   - The script is self-contained and does not rely on external tools or packages.

3. **Permissions**:
   - No special privileges are required to run the script.

### **Installation**
1. Save the script as `satellite_command_emulator.zsh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x satellite_command_emulator.zsh
   ```

### **Running the Emulator**
Run the script:
```bash
./satellite_command_emulator.zsh
```

## **How to Use**

1. **Initialize the Emulator**:
   - Select Option 1 to set up the emulator and create the command log file.

2. **Send Satellite Commands**:
   - Choose Option 2 to send predefined commands to the satellite.
   - Enter the command when prompted, and the emulator will simulate its execution and log the response.

3. **View Command Logs**:
   - Use Option 3 to view a history of all commands and responses recorded in the log file.

4. **Simulate a Spoofed Command Attack**:
   - Select Option 4 to simulate how a malicious actor might inject an unauthorized command, such as a satellite shutdown.

5. **Exit the Emulator**:
   - Select Option 5 to quit the program.

## **Sample Outputs**

### **1. Initializing Emulator**
```bash
Initializing Satellite Command Emulator...
Log file: satellite_commands.log
Satellite Command Log
Emulator initialized.
```

### **2. Sending Commands**
```bash
Enter the satellite command (e.g., POWER_ON, DEPLOY_PANEL): POWER_ON
2024-01-01 10:00:00 - Sending command: POWER_ON
2024-01-01 10:00:00 - Satellite is powering on.
```

### **3. Viewing Logs**
```bash
Displaying Satellite Command Log:
Satellite Command Log
2024-01-01 10:00:00 - Sending command: POWER_ON
2024-01-01 10:00:00 - Satellite is powering on.
```

### **4. Simulating a Spoofed Command Attack**
```bash
Simulating a spoofed command attack...
2024-01-01 10:05:00 - [ALERT] Malicious command received: SHUTDOWN
2024-01-01 10:05:00 - Satellite shutdown initiated (simulated).
```

## **Key Features**

1. **Initialize Auditor**:
   - Prepares the audit environment and sets up a log file to document activities.

2. **Network Scanning**:
   - Uses `nmap` to identify medical devices on the network and log their details.
   - Example: Discovering a heart monitor or infusion pump connected to the hospital's network.

3. **Unauthorized Access Checks**:
   - Simulates analyzing logs to identify failed login attempts or suspicious activity.
   - Example: Detecting repeated failed login attempts on a medical scanner.

4. **Testing for Unencrypted Data Transmissions**:
   - Uses `tcpdump` to scan network traffic for sensitive data sent in plaintext.
   - Example: Intercepting unencrypted usernames and passwords.

5. **View Audit Logs**:
   - Displays a summary of audit findings for analysis and reporting.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Scanning the Network**
- The script uses `nmap` to identify all devices connected to the local network.
- Medical devices are often labeled with identifiable names or MAC addresses.
  
**Example Output:**
```
Scanning network for connected medical devices...
MAC Address: 00:11:22:33:44:55, Device: Medical Scanner MD-12345
MAC Address: 66:77:88:99:AA:BB, Device: Heart Monitor MD-67890
Network scan completed.
```

**What You Learn**:
- How to detect devices on a network and identify potential targets for attackers.

---

### **2. Checking for Unauthorized Access**
- The script simulates analyzing device logs for failed login attempts or unauthorized actions.

**Example Output:**
```
2024-01-01 12:00:00 - Unauthorized login attempt on Device ID: MD-12345
2024-01-01 12:10:00 - Multiple failed login attempts on Device ID: MD-67890
```

**What You Learn**:
- The importance of monitoring device logs for signs of unauthorized access.
- How to use log analysis as part of incident detection and response.

---

### **3. Testing Unencrypted Data Transmission**
- The script uses `tcpdump` to analyze network traffic for sensitive data sent without encryption.

**Example Output:**
```
Testing for unencrypted data transmissions...
Captured data: username=admin, password=123456
Data transmission test completed.
```

**What You Learn**:
- How unencrypted communication can expose sensitive data to attackers.
- The importance of encrypting all data transmitted by medical devices.

---

### **4. Logging and Reporting**
- All findings are saved to a log file for review and analysis.

**Example Log File:**
```
Medical Device Security Audit Log
2024-01-01 12:00:00 - Unauthorized login attempt on Device ID: MD-12345
2024-01-01 12:10:00 - Multiple failed login attempts on Device ID: MD-67890
2024-01-01 12:15:00 - Captured data: username=admin, password=123456
```

**What You Learn**:
- How to document audit findings and use logs to improve device security.

# **Educational README: CAN Bus Data Viewer Script**

## **Overview**

The **CAN Bus Data Viewer Script** is a Zsh-based tool designed to help users interact with and monitor traffic on a **Controller Area Network (CAN) bus**. This script simplifies the process of checking, configuring, and monitoring CAN bus traffic. It’s particularly useful in automotive diagnostics, industrial automation, and IoT device communication.

This README explains how the script works, its educational significance, and its real-world use cases.

## **What the Code Does**

1. **Verifies CAN Interface**:
   - The script checks whether a specified CAN interface (e.g., `can0`) is active.
   - **Why it's important**:
     - Ensures that the system has a functional CAN interface before attempting to monitor traffic.

2. **Brings the CAN Interface Online**:
   - Configures the CAN interface with a bitrate (default: 500,000 bps) and brings it up.
   - **Why it's important**:
     - CAN interfaces must be properly configured to communicate with other devices on the CAN bus.

3. **Monitors CAN Bus Traffic**:
   - Captures and displays real-time CAN traffic using `candump`.
   - **Why it's important**:
     - Monitoring traffic helps identify communication patterns, diagnose issues, and analyze system behavior.

4. **Brings the CAN Interface Offline**:
   - Shuts down the CAN interface to ensure clean operation.
   - **Why it's important**:
     - Prevents interference with other operations or devices when the interface is no longer needed.

5. **Provides an Interactive Menu**:
   - Users can choose actions like checking the interface, monitoring traffic, or exiting the script.
   - **Why it's important**:
     - Makes the tool user-friendly and accessible, even for those with limited experience.
